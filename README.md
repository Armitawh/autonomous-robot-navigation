# CBF & CLF Mobile Robot Obstacle Avoidance

A MATLAB simulation of a unicycle mobile robot performing obstacle avoidance using **Control Barrier Functions (CBF)** and **Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF)**.  
This project demonstrates how to combine safety (avoid obstacles) and goal convergence (reach target) using quadratic programming.

## 📌 Features

- Quadratic Program (QP) formulation for real-time control  
- CBF ensures safety around circular obstacles  
- CLF guarantees convergence to a goal position  
- Visualizes robot trajectory, obstacles, and goal  
- Easy to modify for different obstacles, goals, or robot parameters

## ⚙️ Requirements

- MATLAB R2016a or newer (requires `quadprog` from Optimization Toolbox)
